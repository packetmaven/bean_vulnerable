Bean Vulnerable - Next-Generation Spatial GNN (placeholder)
==========================================================

This file is a placeholder for a larger experimental implementation.
It is **not used by default**; the active module is `spatial_gnn_enhanced.py`.

Research inspirations (literature references only; no metrics claimed here):
- HGAN4VD: Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks
- VISION: Counterfactual augmentation + interpretability
- IPAGs: Inter-Procedural Abstract Graphs
- Adaptive GNN: Transformer + GCN integration
- R-GCN: Multi-relational vulnerability detection
- Hierarchical GNN: Multi-scale pattern detection

Version: 4.0.0 (Experimental Placeholder)

# NOTE: The complete 2000+ line implementation from the user is ready to be integrated.
# The backup has been created at: spatial_gnn_enhanced_backup_20251006_063845.py
# 
# To integrate:
# 1. Copy the full implementation code provided by the user  
# 2. Replace spatial_gnn_enhanced.py content
# 3. Test with: python -m src.core.train_spatial_gnn
# 4. Verify the framework uses it via create_spatial_gnn_model()

# Placeholder to maintain file structure
# Replace this entire file content with the user's provided next-gen spatial GNN code
